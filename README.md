# Cheatsheet Project

This is an off-project via [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) where I created a two webpages containing tables from stratch based on HTML tags and CSS properties including how they appear to be and the purpose they serve. The purpose of this project was to list and define different properties I do not understand or forgotten their uses. 

You can view my cheetsheet [here](https://shan-establishments.github.io/CheatSheet/).

### Updates 04/06/2022
I decided to add a pink background to make the webpage more appealing towards viewers and change the colour and design layout of the titles because I thought the previous layout was too simple. I even changed the font style to monospace and the background colour of the properties and tags. The text are at an appropriate size and space improving the readiblity of the webpage also the background colours and text do not blend with one another giving users with colourblindess the capability to read the information that is presented.

### Webpage 12/02/2022

### What makes the webpages stand out?
This webpage was created using HTML and CSS, HTML for the structure of the table and the information about the elements and properties and I thought I should use brown and cream in order to not only make the webpages stand out but also it could be easily read by users who have certain disabilities such as colourblindness.
