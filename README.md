# CheatSheet

This is an off-project via [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) where I created a cheat sheet from stratch based on HTML tags and CSS properties. 

### What features does this webpage have?
This webpage was created using HTML and CSS. And I used a table to label what the tags/properties are, the name of tags/properties and described what they are and their uses.

Here is my webpage so far...
